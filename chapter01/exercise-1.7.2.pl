/* What are the two syntax errors in the following?

located_in (at lanta, georgia).

*/

/*

First, in a structure there can't be whitespace between the functor
and the opening parenthesis. Second, "at lanta" is not a term, if
the intention is to have an atom you need to ged rid of the blank,
or else put quotes around it.
